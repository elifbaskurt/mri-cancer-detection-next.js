## 🧠 Cancer Type Detection from MR Images using Deep Learning

This project is a web-based application that allows users to **analyze MR images and predict cancer types** using pretrained deep learning models such as **MobileNet**. It was developed with **Next.js** for the frontend and can handle multiple cancer categories like brain, breast, lung, and more.

### 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Cancer Type Selection Modal**
  Users can select the type of cancer they want to analyze (Brain, Breast, Cervical, Kidney, etc.).

* 📁 **MR Image Upload & Preview**
  Upload MR images and see a preview before prediction.

* 🤖 **Model Selection**
  Supports different model architectures (e.g., MobileNet) for flexibility and comparison.

* 🌐 **Multilingual Support**
  Easily switch between languages (English, Turkish, etc.).

* 🧠 **AI-Powered Predictions**
  Backend-integrated AI model processes the uploaded image and returns the prediction result.
